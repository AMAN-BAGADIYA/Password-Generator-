# Password-Generator-
A password, sometimes called a passcode is secret data, typically a string of characters, usually used to confirm a user's identity.
## Random Module 



Random Module is used to perform the random generation. We will use the random.sample module here!
## String Module 



The string module contains a number of useful constants classes and a number of functions to process the standard Python string


In order to access the Python library, we need to import it into a Python script. So, start by importing the packages in the script.
We will make thee use of a string module to define our data and finally use a random module (random.sample) to generate our password.
